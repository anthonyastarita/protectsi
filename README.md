Protect-SI is a tool designed to give Staten Island the necessary data to fight COVID-19. Please click on the markers on the map to learn about what citizens in your neighborhood are saying about COVID-19. Learning about the experiences of citizens who tested positive for the virus can help us understand:

-who is infected
-where the infection occurred
-how the virus was transmitted.


Please click on the “Form” button on the top right part of the screen if you have any information you’d like to share ESPECIALLY if you tested positive/live with someone who tested positive/are showing significant symptoms.
